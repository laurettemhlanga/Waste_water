 # use Juliet's data as is 
 # in the waste water data find the N weeks (1 - 6) rolling average in the log copies
   # Log(this week) exceeds Log (mean of previous weeks) by Log (1+X) N_prev = 1, 2,3, â€¦ 
   # add new column called test i.e. if Log(this week) > Log (mean of previous N_weeks) assign 1 else 0 if NA 
   assign NA
 # merge the data 
 # exctract/filter the dates in which the column entered == 1
